/**
 * A simple dice game.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The objective of this game is to find the number of dice rolls necessary to get to the desired number.
 * The game is played with two dice. The number found should be printed on the screen.
 * 
 * <p>
 * You are free to create as many methods and classes as you like to write up the code. It's not necessary
 * to restrict yourself to only this . Additionally, you can use any library you find appropriate,
 * except of course one that would have this exact functionality...
 * 
 * <p>
 * Remark: As this code is driven by (semi-)random behavior, i.e. the roll of dice, we intend not to discuss
 * the outcome, but the structure of the code and the chosen solution method. We therefore haven't provided
 * any test cases to demonstrate the correct behavior.
